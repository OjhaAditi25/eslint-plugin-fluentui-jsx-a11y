## To create a new ESLint rule

### eslint:rule

If you want to create a new ESLint rule, make sure you're in the top-level directory and type:

## Pull requests

First, create a new branch

```sh
git checkout -b users/<username or alias>/bug1234
```

Post change, ensure to run the build command to generate the respective output file in the dist folder:

```sh
npm run build
```

Commit the changes to your branch, including a descriptive commit message.

```sh
git commit -m 'message describing the changes'
```

Before sending the pull request, make sure your code is running on the latest code from the main repo by rebasing onto the upstream source.

```sh
git fetch upstream
git rebase upstream/main
#or
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/main
```

Verify your changes

```sh
npm test
npm run lint
```

Push your changes

```sh
git push origin users/<username or alias>/bug1234
